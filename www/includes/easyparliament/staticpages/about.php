<p>For all its faults and foibles, our democracy is a profound gift from previous generations.
Yet most people don't know the name of their representative, let alone what they
do or say in their name.</p>

<p>We aim to help bridge this growing democratic disconnect, in the belief that there is
little wrong with Parliament that a healthy mixture of transparency and public engagement won't fix.</p>

<p>Hence this website.</p>

<h3>Who runs this site?</h3>

<p>OpenAustralia is a website run by a group of volunteers.
We owe a great debt to a UK charity, mySociety, which built <a href="http://theyworkforyou.com/">theyworkforyou.com</a> which this site is based on.

<h3><a name="history"></a>History</h3>

<p>Back in 2004 Matthew Landauer and Katherine Szuminska were lucky enough to accidently find themselves at the launch of
	the UK site <a href="http://theyworkforyou.com">TheyWorkForYou.com</a> at a nerdy techno conference, NotCon 2004. The talk
	inspired them hugely and they left with a desire to make this happen in Australia too. It took a few years, other people
	came on board to help and here you can see the fruits of their labour.</p>

And if it's worth doing, you might as well try to do it well. </em></p>
